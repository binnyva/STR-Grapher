STR Grapher

Retrives the number of votes from a source, saves it to a text file, shows the data as graphs.

grapher.php : Will be executed using cron. On an hourly or minutely basis.
info.txt : Where the hourly data is stored
minute.txt : Where the minutely data is stored.

You will need my 'iframe' PHP library to actually run this scirpt - http://www.bin-co.com/php/scripts/iframe/

This is not the best way to do it - but the most easiest way to do it. I created the entire thing in around one and a half hours.

Finally, if you are a geek - and want to help MAD out on the tech side, contact me. I'm always on the lookout for people like that.
